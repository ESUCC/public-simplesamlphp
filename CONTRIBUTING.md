# Contributing

Please create an issue before making a change. 
This repository utilizes the GitFlow branching model.

## Merge Request Process

1. The `development` and `master` branches will always contain working code.
2. The `development` and `master` branches will never be directly commited to.
3. `feature/some-feature` branches are the only method to commit to `development` via a *merge request*.
4. `hotfix/some-hotfix` and `development` branches are the only method to commit to `master` via a *merge request*.
5. Update the `CHANGELOG` with changes.
6. Use clear commit messages, granular commits.
